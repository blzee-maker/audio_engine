## Intermediate Phase — Frozen

DSP architecture stabilized:
- Ducking (envelope-based)
- Dialogue compression
- Peak normalization
- Clip fades

Renderer responsibilities reduced to orchestration only.
All DSP units independently tested and verified.

Further changes belong to Advanced phase only.
