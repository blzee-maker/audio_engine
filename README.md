🎧 Audio Engine

A timeline-based audio rendering engine that generates final audio output from structured JSON timeline files.
The engine reads timestamped audio events and renders them into a single, mixed audio track with precise control over timing, layering, and transitions.

📥 Input: Timeline JSON

The engine consumes a JSON file describing when and how audio assets should play.

{
  "timeline": [
    {
      "time": 0.0,
      "type": "ambience",
      "audio": "street_night.wav",
      "loop": true
    },
    {
      "time": 2.5,
      "type": "dialogue",
      "speaker": "Aarav",
      "audio": "aarav_01.wav"
    },
    {
      "time": 6.0,
      "type": "sfx",
      "audio": "door_close.wav"
    }
  ]
}


Each event is executed exactly at its timestamp, ensuring deterministic output.

⚙️ How It Works

Parses the timeline JSON

Sorts events by timestamp

Loads audio assets into memory

Layers multiple audio tracks (dialogue, ambience, music, SFX)

Applies transitions and effects

Renders a single final audio file

🧩 Supported Audio Types

🎙️ Dialogue

🌿 Ambience (looped or timed)

🎵 Background Music

🔊 Sound Effects

Each type is handled independently and mixed together during rendering.
